# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

Scenario: non-iid_label_skew_(heterogeneity)
- Partition: IID random client splits (non-IID label skew not implemented).
- Label noise: 10% global symmetric flips applied in data generation.
- Special processing/algorithm: No scenario-specific changes; standard feature normalization; no per-client feature shift injection.
- Key differences: None; SFedAvg uses one-sided projected momentum (Pi = P P^T) and communication accounting identical to other scenarios.

Scenario: robustness_to_noise_and_outliers
- Partition: IID random splits; heterogeneous corruption applied per client.
- Label noise: per-client random flips with rate ~30% (uniform in [0.2, 0.4]).
- Special processing/algorithm: Inject ~5% heavy-tailed (Cauchy) feature outliers per client; SFedAvg uses one-sided projected momentum with Pi = P P^T; conditional communication accounting.
- Key differences: Per-client unequal noise and outliers; added robust metrics (accuracy at rounds, rounds_to_70_acc, max_loss_spike) to assess resilience.

Scenario: scalability:_high-dimensional,_large-scale
- Partition: IID equal-sized random partitions across 200 clients.
- Label noise: None; labels balanced by ranking logits to achieve ~50/50 classes.
- Special processing/algorithm: Feature standardization and bias term; SFedAvg communicates round-wise projector Pi_t (d x d); added metrics: comm_per_0.8_acc and rounds_to_target_loss.
- Key differences: Large dataset (200k samples) and high dimension (d=200); emphasizes convergence–communication trade-off (FedAvg lower communication; SFedAvg potentially faster per-round convergence but higher communication).
