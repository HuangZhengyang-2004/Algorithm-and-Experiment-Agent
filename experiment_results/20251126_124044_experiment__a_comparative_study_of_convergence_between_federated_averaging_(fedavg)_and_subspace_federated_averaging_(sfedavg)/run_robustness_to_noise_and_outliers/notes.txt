# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

Scenario: non-iid_label_skew_(heterogeneity)
- Partition: IID random client splits (non-IID label skew not implemented).
- Label noise: 10% global symmetric flips applied in data generation.
- Special processing/algorithm: No scenario-specific changes; standard feature normalization; no per-client feature shift injection.
- Key differences: None; SFedAvg uses one-sided projected momentum (Pi = P P^T) and communication accounting identical to other scenarios.
