  "expected_improvement": "Compared to baseline, these settings should reduce max loss spikes by ~20–40%, yield smoother loss curves, and increase robust accuracy at key rounds by ~1–3%. SFedAvg should benefit most from tuned momentum and shorter local steps, while FedAvg primarily improves via smaller stepsize and reduced tau."
