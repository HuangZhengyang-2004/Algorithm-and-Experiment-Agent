Increasing client_fraction strengthens averaging across diverse label distributions, reducing drift. Reducing local_steps limits local overfitting to skewed labels. Momentum in SFedAvg controls how projected gradients accumulate; tuning mu can damp oscillations and improve stability with skew.",

  "expected_improvement": "Compared to baseline, configurations with higher client_fraction (0.4–0.6) and fewer local_steps (2–4) should yield smoother loss, 1–3% higher test accuracy, reduced oscillations, and potentially fewer rounds to reach target accuracy, with SFedAvg benefitting most from tuned momentum."
