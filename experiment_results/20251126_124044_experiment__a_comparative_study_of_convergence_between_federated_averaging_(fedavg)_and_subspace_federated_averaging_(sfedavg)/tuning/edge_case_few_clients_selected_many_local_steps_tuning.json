  "expected_improvement": "Relative to baseline (eta=0.15, tau=50, mu=0.95), we expect 30–50% lower max loss spikes, earlier attainment of 0.7 accuracy (rounds_to_0.7_acc reduced by ~20–40%), improved area_under_accuracy_curve_sfedavg by ~10–20%, and fewer rounds_to_target_loss_sfedavg (−20–40%). Stability should increase notably for SFedAvg under r=1 while maintaining or improving test accuracy."
