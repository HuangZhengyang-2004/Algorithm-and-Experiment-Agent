Best Configuration:
The top-performing SFedAvg setting is momentum=0.8, subspace_dim=32, stepsize=0.08 (config 6). It achieved rounds_to_target_loss_sfedavg=8 and comm_per_0.8_acc_sfedavg=1,144,330—both the best among all tested configurations. Its area_under_accuracy_curve_sfedavg reached 32.675, indicating a faster accuracy ramp than baseline. The stability_index_sfedavg was lower (~71.5), reflecting a speed–stability trade-off.

Performance Improvement:
Compared to baseline (μ=0.9, r=8, η=0.12), config 6 reduced rounds_to_target_loss_sfedavg from 24 to 8 (−66.7%). Communication to reach 0.8 accuracy dropped from 3,432,990 to 1,144,330 (−66.7%). Area under the accuracy curve improved by ~17.3%. Stability_index decreased by ~55%, indicating increased volatility with the faster convergence.

Parameter Insights:
Subspace dimension r was the strongest lever; increasing r to 32 unlocked faster convergence and large communication savings when paired with appropriate stepsize. Stepsize interacted critically with r and μ; reducing η to 0.08 stabilized the higher-dimensional projection and enabled aggressive acceleration without obvious divergence. Momentum controlled the speed–stability balance: moderate–high μ (0.8–0.9) accelerated but increased volatility, while μ=0.0 improved stability at the cost of much slower convergence and higher communication to reach 0.8 accuracy.

Recommendation:
Use SFedAvg with momentum=0.8, subspace_dim=32, stepsize=0.08 for this scenario to maximize speed and communication efficiency. If stability is the priority, prefer momentum=0.7, subspace_dim=8, stepsize=0.1 (config 3) or consider momentum=0.5, subspace_dim=32, stepsize=0.1 (config 4) for a balanced alternative. Keep other parameters at scenario defaults and monitor stability_index to ensure acceptable volatility for deployment.
