# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

Scenario: IID Baseline Convergence
Partition: IID uniform client splits with balanced labels.
Label noise: 0% (none); Gaussian feature/logit noise only in data generation for realism.
Processing/Algorithm: feature standardization; SFedAvg uses per-round one-sided subspace P_t with projector Π_t, momentum projection at block start, uplink compression with cumulative communication metrics; differs by having no heterogeneity/corruption and moderate d=30, r=10 (FedAvg μ=0 vs SFedAvg μ=0.9).
