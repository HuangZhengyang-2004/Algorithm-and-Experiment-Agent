# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.
