Best Configuration:
The best-performing configuration is SFedAvg with --lr=0.12, --mu=0.85, --subspace_dim=20.
This setup consistently achieved the highest final test accuracy (≈0.8415) and the lowest final train loss (≈0.7298).
It balances a larger subspace with moderate momentum, improving stability and convergence speed.

Performance Improvement:
Compared to baseline (final accuracy ≈0.7485, final loss ≈1.2630), the best config improves accuracy by ≈12.4% relative and reduces final train loss by ≈42.2%.
Note that communication per round increases (uplink +800 vs +400; downlink +3600 vs +2400), so gains come with higher communication cost.

Parameter Insights:
Learning rate had a strong positive impact on speed and final accuracy up to 0.12 before instability (when paired with appropriate μ and r).
Subspace dimension r strongly influenced performance: larger r (12–20) outperformed small r (e.g., r=1) which severely degraded accuracy.
Momentum μ requires balance: very high μ (0.99) with small r underperformed; moderate μ (0.85–0.9) with larger r stabilized and accelerated convergence.

Recommendation:
Use SFedAvg with --lr=0.12, --mu=0.85, --subspace_dim=20 for this IID baseline scenario, keeping other parameters at defaults.
If communication budget is tight, a compromise like --lr=0.08, --mu=0.95, --subspace_dim=12 achieves strong accuracy with lower communication than r=20.
