# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

Scenario 'iid-baseline-convergence': IID stratified partition across 20 clients with balanced label proportions per client.
Label noise: None (0%).
Processing/Algorithm: Features z-score standardized; SFedAvg samples a per-round one-sided random subspace with momentum projection; FedAvg uses full-space momentum; deterministic round-robin client selection.
Distinctive aspects: Pure IID baseline to isolate the effect of subspace projection with momentum; logs train loss, test accuracy, and cumulative communication per round.
