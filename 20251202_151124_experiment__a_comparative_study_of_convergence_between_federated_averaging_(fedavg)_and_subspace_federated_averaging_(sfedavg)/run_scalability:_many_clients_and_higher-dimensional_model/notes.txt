# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

baseline_head-to-head_(moderate_regime): Non-IID label-skew via contiguous label blocks across 30 clients (heterogeneous).
No label noise added (0% flips); deterministic synthetic dataset with standardized features from a fixed teacher.
Algorithm specifics: SFedAvg samples a new one-sided subspace P_t each round and applies momentum projection; FedAvg uses full space; both use identical hyperparameters and rolling client selection.
Evaluation special: cumulative_comm_floats includes P_t transmission cost for SFedAvg in addition to model deltas, enabling fair communication comparison.

heterogeneity_stress_(high_local_drift): Non-IID extreme label-skew via noniid_classes partition (classes_per_client=2) across 50 clients (heterogeneous).
No label noise added (0% flips); deterministic synthetic dataset with standardized features from a fixed teacher.
Algorithm specifics: high local drift with --local_steps 20 and --client_fraction 0.1; SFedAvg uses one-sided subspace (r=10) with momentum projection; FedAvg uses full space; deterministic rolling client selection.
Evaluation special: cumulative_comm_floats accounts for P_t transmission in SFedAvg; intended to compare stability and early-round loss vs FedAvg under identical settings.

robustness_to_label_noise_(client-local_corruption): Non-IID via noniid_classes partition (classes_per_client=2) across 30 clients.
Label noise: 20% label flips applied to 30% of clients (deterministically selected); remaining clients uncorrupted.
Algorithm specifics: SFedAvg uses one-sided subspace (r=15) with momentum projection; FedAvg uses full space; identical hyperparameters and rolling client selection.
Implementation note: Label corruption injected post-partition using per-client RNG; cumulative_comm_floats includes P_t transmission cost for SFedAvg as in other scenarios.
