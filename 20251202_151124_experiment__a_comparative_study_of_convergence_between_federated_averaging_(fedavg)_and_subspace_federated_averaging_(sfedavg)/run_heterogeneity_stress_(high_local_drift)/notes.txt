# Title: Experiment: A Comparative Study of Convergence between Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg)
# Experiment description: Compare the convergence behavior of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Subspace Federated Averaging (SFedAvg) on a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10) under identical settings. Measure metrics such as training loss, test accuracy, and communication efficiency over multiple rounds of training.

## Experiment Log

baseline_head-to-head_(moderate_regime): Non-IID label-skew via contiguous label blocks across 30 clients (heterogeneous).
No label noise added (0% flips); deterministic synthetic dataset with standardized features from a fixed teacher.
Algorithm specifics: SFedAvg samples a new one-sided subspace P_t each round and applies momentum projection; FedAvg uses full space; both use identical hyperparameters and rolling client selection.
Evaluation special: cumulative_comm_floats includes P_t transmission cost for SFedAvg in addition to model deltas, enabling fair communication comparison.
